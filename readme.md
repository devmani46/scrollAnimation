The JavaScript code in script.js listens for scroll events and adjusts the font size of each section's text based on how much of that section is visible in the viewport.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Listen for scroll events: window.addEventListener('scroll', () => { ... }); runs the code every time the user scrolls.

Get all sections: const sections = document.querySelectorAll('.section'); finds all elements with class "section".

Get scroll position and viewport height: const scrollY = window.scrollY; (how far down the page is scrolled), const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight; (height of the visible area).

For each section:

Calculate the section's position: sectionTop (top of section), sectionBottom (bottom of section).
Figure out how much of the section is visible: visibleTop, visibleBottom, visibleHeight.
Calculate progress as a number from 0 to 1 (0 = not visible, 1 = fully visible).
Compute scale = 1 + progress * 9; (starts at 1 when progress=0, goes to 10 when progress=1).
Set the font size: fontSize = scale + 'rem'; and apply it to the span inside the section.
So, as you scroll and a section becomes more visible, its text grows from 1rem to 10rem. When you scroll away, it shrinks back down.
